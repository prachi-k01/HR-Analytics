## Case Background  
A mid-sized company is facing challenges related to:

- High employee turnover
- Limited insight into diversity and pay equity
- Inconsistent hiring outcomes
  
**Tools used:** SQL ‚Ä¢ PowerBI ‚Ä¢ Python ‚Ä¢ GitHub

## Objective
To support HR managers and business leaders in reducing attrition, identifying key performance and satisfaction drivers, and gaining clarity on hiring sources, diversity, and pay equity.

### Business Questions Answered
1. What is the company's current attrition rate, and how does it differ by department?
2. What are the top reasons employees are leaving?
3. Does shorter tenure significantly increase attrition risk?
4. Are there any gender or pay equity concerns across roles and departments?
5. Which recruitment sources are associated with higher employee turnover?
6. How do satisfaction, engagement, and performance scores correlate with attrition?
7. Can we accurately predict which employees are likely to leave next?

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) üìä
| KPI                                  | Description                                      |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Total Employees**                  | Total number of employees in the dataset         |
| **Active Employees**                 | Employees currently employed (not terminated)    |
| **Attrition Rate (%)**               | % of employees who have left                     |
| **Avg. Satisfaction Score**          | Self-reported employee satisfaction              |
| **Male/Female Ratio**                | Gender distribution across company               |

### Areas of Analysis & Visualizations
- Overall Attrition Rate
- Termination Reasons ‚Äì most common exit causes

### Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Checked for blanks and duplicates
- Removed unnecessary fields
- Ensured correct data types

        WHEN TIMESTAMPDIFF(YEAR, DOB, '2020-01-01') BETWEEN 36 AND 45 THEN '36-45'
        WHEN TIMESTAMPDIFF(YEAR, DOB, '2020-01-01') BETWEEN 46 AND 60 THEN '46-60'
        ELSE '60+'
    END AS age_bucket
FROM hr_data
GROUP BY age_bucket
ORDER BY age_bucket;
```
```sql
Most Common Termination Reasons
SELECT 
    TermReason, 
    COUNT(*) AS emp_count 
FROM hr_data 
WHERE Termd = 1 
GROUP BY TermReason 
ORDER BY emp_count DESC;
```
```sql
Attrition by Recruitment Source (Hotspots)
SELECT 
    RecruitmentSource,
    COUNT(*) AS terminated_count
FROM hr_data 
WHERE Termd = 1 
GROUP BY RecruitmentSource 
ORDER BY terminated_count DESC;
```
```sql
Attrition by Department
SELECT 
    Department, 
    COUNT(CASE WHEN Termd = 1 THEN 1 END) AS terminated
FROM hr_data
GROUP BY Department
ORDER BY Department DESC;
```
 
### What‚Äôs Next ‚ùì
This project was completed using both visual tools (PowerBI) and code-driven analysis (Python) to provide a full-stack business intelligence solution.
Additional deep-dives included:
 - Decision Tree Model - To predict attrition
 - Graphs on relation between Satisfaction, Performance and Attrition
  
### Dashboard Preview

### Python Analysis

#### 1. To predict which employees are likely to leave the company, I trained a Decision Tree classifier using features like:
     - Tenure
     - Engagement score
     - Satisfaction rating
     - Performance score
     - Department and position
     - Recruitment source

| Metric                  | Score |
| ----------------------- | ----- |
| **Accuracy**            | 75%   |
| **Precision (Leavers)** | 79%   |
| **Recall (Leavers)**    | 46%   |
| **F1-Score (Leavers)**  | 58%   |

Interpretation:
- The model correctly predicted 75% of employees.
- It was very good at predicting who will stay.
- It caught about half of the employees who actually left, useful as a risk flag, though not perfect.

Below is a visual diagram of the decision tree used to classify employee attrition. The tree shows that low tenure, low engagement, and certain roles or hiring sources are key indicators of attrition risk.

#### 2. Satisfaction vs. Attrition - analyzed how employee satisfaction impacts attrition.
![attritionVSsatisfaction](python/attrition_vs_satisfaction.png)

| Satisfaction Score | Attrition Rate |
| ------------------ | -------------- |
| 1 (Very Low)       | 0.00           |
| 2 (Low)            | 44.4%          |
| 3 (Neutral)        | 30.6%          |
| 4 (High)           | 40.4%          |
| 5 (Very High)      | 29.6%          |

#### 3. Performance Score vs. Attrition
![attritionVperformance](python/attrition_vs_performance.png)
| Performance Score | Description        | Attrition Rate       |
| ----------------- | ------------------ | -------------------- |
| 1                 | Low                | 30.8%                |
| 2                 | Meets Expectations | **55.6%**  (Highest) |
| 3                 | Exceeds            | 33.7%                |
| 4                 | Outstanding        | **21.6%**  (Lowest)  |



### Key Insights

1. The company's overall attrition rate is 33.44%, which is relatively high.
2. Production department experiences the highest attrition, with most exits coming from employees hired via Google Search and Indeed.
3. The most common reasons for leaving include: ‚ÄúAnother position‚Äù, ‚ÄúMore money‚Äù, and ‚ÄúUnhappy‚Äù ‚Äî indicating external opportunities and dissatisfaction.
4. Employees with tenure less than 2.3 years are significantly more likely to leave, suggesting early-stage engagement and retention challenges.
5. There is a slight gender pay gap (M: $70.63K, F: $67.79K), and it‚Äôs also seen within the Production department ‚Äî worth monitoring for equity.
6. Recruitment sources like Google Search, Indeed, and LinkedIn are associated with higher turnover.
7. Satisfaction score of 2 has the highest attrition rate (~44%), while score 5 shows the lowest (~29%).
8. Performance score of 2 (meets expectations) had the highest attrition (~56%), while top performers (score 4) had the lowest (~21%).
9. A Decision Tree model achieved 75% prediction accuracy ‚Äî with key risk factors including low tenure, low engagement, and certain recruitment sources.
10. The model can be used as a risk-flagging tool to help HR proactively retain employees.
